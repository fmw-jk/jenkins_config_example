# jenkins_config_example

This repository is an example of a `jenkins_config` repository which is necessary for the usage of a cob-pipeline.

> For further informations about the cob-pipeline, check the [`jenkins_setup` repository](https://github.com/ipa320/jenkins_setup/).

**This is only an example. If you want to use the cob-pipeline, fork this repository and rename it to 'jenkins_config'!**

The later structure of your `jenkins_config` repository is like shown in this repository.
